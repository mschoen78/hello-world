# hello-world

Hello humans,

this is Matthias who is using GitHub for the first in his life. Generally speaking it does not look too difficult and I can understand the basic concept of programming. Hopefully it wont take me too long to grab the basics of programming, so that I can start working on my own projects.

Cool stuff in general!

Cheers
Matthias
